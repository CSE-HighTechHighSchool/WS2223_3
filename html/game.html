              <strong>VEX Robotics Competition: Spin Up</strong> is the VRC game for the 2022-2023 VRC season.
              The game involves using a robot to launch discs into a frisbee golf-like goal, while also manipulating roller devices on the field and expanding the robot to score additional points at the end of the match.
              Matches are played tournament-style, with a preliminary qualification round and a final elimination round.
            </p>

            <h3>The Object</h3>
            <p>
              Each Spin Up match consists of four teams, split into two alliances (red and blue) of two teams (and therefore, two robots) each.
              Each alliance tries to score more points than the other by scoring discs in high and low goals, rotating rollers to match their alliance's color, and expanding their robots in the endgame.
            </p>

            <h3>The Field</h3>
            <p>
              Spin Up is played on a square, 12' x 12' field. A total of 38 small, round, yellow discs are placed in stacks of one or three at designated locations on the field.
              In opposite corners of the field, there are raised high goal baskets (one red, one blue), with a square low goal of the opposite color below.
              Additionally, mounted on the field walls are four red-and-blue, cylindrical rollers that can be rotated by the robots.
            </p>

            <h3>The Match</h3>
            <p>
              Each head-to-head match begins with a 15 second autonomous period. During this time, the robots can score points while controlling themselves, with no human input whatsoever.
              Sensors on the robot and preprogrammed routines are used to make decisions during the autonomous period.
              After the autonomous period ends, the field is scored, and the alliance with the most points is awarded an autonomous bonus that will be added to their score at the very end of the match.
              Alliances also have the opportunity to earn an "autonomous win point" if they perform certain tasks during the autonomous period. This win point can help teams achieve a higher ranking during the qualification round of the tournament.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the autonomous bonus is awarded, the match enters into a 1 minute 45 second driver controlled period, in which a human driver controls the robot (with autonomous assistance, if teams so desire).
              As with the autonomous period, teams can continue to score discs and rollers during this period.
              Discs are scored by picking them up from the field and shooting them into the alliance's high goal, but robots must be careful not to miss, as the disc could fall to the opposing alliance's low goal and score points for them.
              Cylindrical rollers can be spun by the robots to match the color of their alliance, also scoring them points.
              A variety of strategies can be used during the match to accumulate as many points as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the last 10 seconds of the driver controlled period, the size limits that previously restricted robots are removed, allowing robots to expand to touch additional tiles on the field and score additional points.
